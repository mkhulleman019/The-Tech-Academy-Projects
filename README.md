# Tech-Academy-Projects

This repository is for many of my Tech Academy Projects. The description of each prject is as follows:

In the Basic_HTML_and_CSS folder youâ€™ll find projects such as:

basic_css_demo1 : This page was used to practice CSS transitions for boxes. These boxes changed in size, positon, and color.

challenges: This was used for one of the final assignments in which I had to create a page that had a working nav with hover effects, an image with overlaid text and a hover effect, transitions over a photo and video, a table, and a video that autoplays (muted) on a loop.

css_menu_rollover: This page was used to practice css rollover effects on a nav.

htmlTableCol: This page was used to practice inline effects for columns in html.

newSkillCSS: This assignment was to look at W3Schools and find an HTML element and a CSS element we were unfamiliar with and implement it. I chose to feature a favicon in the title bar and use a gradient background using CSS.

viewportChallenge: This was one of our final challenges in which we began to explore responsive sites. The ojective was to implement the meta viewport to change the color of the background once the screen was less than 600px wide.

In the project folder livCosmetics you will find the following:
	index: This site was one of our assignments where we needed to create a menu with a 			hover effect, a background image with overlaid text, a gallery within a container that 			utilized transitions, and a practice form. For this site, I utilized a brand I created a few 			years back for a different project.

The remaining folders are:

bootstrap4_project: This page was used to practice implementing bootstrap 4. We utilized bootsrap to create the nav, columns, a list, cards, badges, and forms.

One_Page_Website: This project was used to test skills utilizing HTML and CSS. In this we created a nav with a background image and hover effects, a gallery with hover and transformation effects on the images, and a form.

Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1: contains basic practice files that utilize html and minimal JS.

vsPractice: this file was used to create a practice page in which we learned to use VS Share.
